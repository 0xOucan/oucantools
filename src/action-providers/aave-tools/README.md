- **Borrow against supplied collateral**: Allows users to borrow funds based on the collateral they have supplied.
- **Repay borrowed positions**: Users can repay their borrowed amounts at any time.
- **Withdraw supplied assets**: Users can withdraw their supplied assets when needed.
- **Real-time position monitoring**: Keep track of your positions and health factors in real-time.
- **Gas-optimized for L2 networks**: Designed to minimize gas costs on Layer 2 networks.

## Supported Assets

Currently supports the following assets on Base Sepolia:
- USDC
- WETH

## Prerequisites

1. **Base Sepolia network connection**: Ensure you are connected to the Base Sepolia network.
2. **Sufficient asset balance for operations**: Make sure you have enough assets for the operations you want to perform.
3. **ETH for gas fees**: You will need ETH to cover transaction fees.

## Usage

### Supply Assets

```typescript
const result = await aaveProvider.supplyAsset(wallet, {
    asset: "USDC",
    amount: "1000000" // 1 USDC (6 decimals)
});
```

### Borrow Assets

```typescript
const result = await aaveProvider.borrowAsset(wallet, {
    asset: "USDC",
    amount: "1000000" // 1 USDC (6 decimals)
});
```

### Repay Borrowed Position

```typescript
const result = await aaveProvider.repayBorrow(wallet, {
    asset: "USDC",
    amount: "1000000" // 1 USDC (6 decimals)
});
``` 

### Withdraw Supplied Assets

```typescript
const result = await aaveProvider.withdrawAsset(wallet, {
    asset: "USDC",
    amount: "1000000" // 1 USDC (6 decimals)    
});
```

## Error Handling

The provider implements comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages:

```typescript
try {
    await aaveProvider.supplyAsset(wallet, params);
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof AaveError) {
        console.log(`Error Code: ${error.code}`);
        console.log(`Message: ${error.message}`);
        console.log(`Details: ${error.details}`);
    } else {
        console.log(`Unexpected error: ${error}`);
    }
}
```

### Common Error Codes
- `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`: Not enough tokens for the operation.
- `HEALTH_FACTOR_TOO_LOW`: Operation would risk liquidation.
- `INSUFFICIENT_COLLATERAL`: Not enough collateral for borrowing.
- `MARKET_FROZEN`: Market temporarily unavailable.

## Important Considerations

1. **Health Factor**: Maintain a health factor above 1 to avoid liquidation. Regularly check your health factor after each transaction.
2. **Market Conditions**: Check current interest rates before borrowing to ensure favorable terms.
3. **Gas Optimization**: Uses L2-optimized contracts for reduced gas costs; monitor gas prices before executing transactions.
4. **Asset Caps**: Be aware of supply and borrow caps for each asset to avoid transaction failures.
